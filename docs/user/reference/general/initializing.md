# Initializing

Glean needs to be initialized in order to be able to send pings,
record metrics and perform maintenance tasks. Thus is is advised that Glean be initialized as
soon as possible in an application's lifetime and importantly, before any other libraries in the
application start using Glean.

{{#include ../../../shared/blockquote-info.html}}

## Libraries are not required to initialize Glean

> Libraries rely on the same Glean singleton as the application in which they are
> embedded. Hence, they are not expected to initialize Glean
> as the application should already do that.

## Behavior when uninitialized

Any API called before Glean is initialized is queued and applied at initialization.
To avoid unbounded memory growth the queue is bounded (currently to a maximum of 100 tasks),
and further calls are dropped.

The number of calls dropped, if any,
is recorded in the `glean.error.preinit_tasks_overflow` metric.

## Behavior once initialized

### When upload is enabled

Once initialized, if upload is enabled,
Glean will automatically start applying enqueued tasks, such as
collection of [baseline metrics](../../user/pings/metrics.md).

### When upload is disabled

If upload is disabled, any persisted metrics, events and pings (other than `first_run_date` and `first_run_hour`) are cleared, any pending deletion-request is sent and subsequent calls to record metrics and submit pings will be no-ops. Because Glean does that as part of its initialization, users are _required_ to always initialize Glean.

**Glean must be initialized even if upload is disabled**.

This does not apply to special builds where telemetry is disabled at build time.
In that case, it is acceptable to not call initialize at all.

## API

### `Glean.initialize(configuration)`

Initializes Glean.

May only be called once. Subsequent calls to `initialize` are no-op.

#### Configuration

The available initialize configuration options may vary depending on the SDK.
Below are listed the configuration options available on most SDKs.

- `applicationId`: Application identifier. For Android and iOS applications, this is the id used on the platform's respective app store and is extracted automatically from the application context.
- `uploadEnabled`: The user preference on whether or not data upload is enabled.
- `appChannel`: The application's release channel. When present, the `app_channel` will be reported on all pings [`client_info`](../../user/pings/index.html#the-client_info-section) section.
- `appBuild`: A build identifier e.g. the build identifier generated by a CI system (e.g. "1234/A"). If not present, `app_build` will be reported as "Unknown" on all pings [`client_info`](../../user/pings/index.html#the-client_info-section) section.
- `appDisplayVersion`: The user visible version string for the application running Glean. If not present, `app_display_version` will be reported as "Unknown" on all pings [`client_info`](../../user/pings/index.html#the-client_info-section) section.
- `serverEndpoint`: The server pings are sent to. Defaults to `https://incoming.telemetry.mozilla.org`.

To learn about SDK specific configuration options available, refer to the [Reference](#reference) section.

##### Always initialize Glean with the correct value upload preference

> Glean must **always** be initialized with real values.
>
> Always pass the user preference, e.g. `Glean.initialize(upload=userSettings.telemetry_enabled)` or the equivalent for your application. Never call `Glean.initialize(upload=true)` if `true` is a placeholder value that later gets reset by `Glean.setUploadEnabled(false)` and vice-versa.
>
> Depending on the provided placeholder value, this might trigger the generation of new client ids or the submission of bogus [`deletion-request` pings](../../user/pings/deletion-request.md).

<div data-lang="Kotlin" class="tab">

An excellent place to initialize Glean is within the `onCreate` method of the class that extends Android's `Application` class.

```Kotlin
import org.mozilla.yourApplication.GleanMetrics.GleanBuildInfo
import org.mozilla.yourApplication.GleanMetrics.Pings

class SampleApplication : Application() {

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()

        // If you have custom pings in your application, you must register them
        // using the following command. This command should be omitted for
        // applications not using custom pings.
        Glean.registerPings(Pings)

        // Initialize the Glean library.
        Glean.initialize(
            applicationContext,
            // Here, `settings()` is a method to get user preferences, specific to
            // your application and not part of the Glean API.
            uploadEnabled = settings().isTelemetryEnabled,
            buildInfo = GleanBuildInfo.buildInfo
        )
    }
}
```

The Glean Kotlin SDK does not support use across multiple processes, and must only be initialized on the application's main process. Initializing in other processes is a no-op.

Additionally, Glean must be initialized on the main (UI) thread of the applications main process. Failure to do so will throw an `IllegalThreadStateException`.

### Consuming Glean through Android Components

When the Glean Kotlin SDK is consumed through Android Components,
it is required to configure an HTTP client to be used for upload.

For example:

```Kotlin
// Requires `org.mozilla.components:concept-fetch`
import mozilla.components.concept.fetch.Client

// Requires `org.mozilla.components:lib-fetch-httpurlconnection`.
// This can be replaced by other implementations, e.g. `lib-fetch-okhttp`
// or an implementation from `browser-engine-gecko`.
import mozilla.components.lib.fetch.httpurlconnection.HttpURLConnectionClient
import mozilla.components.service.glean.config.Configuration
import mozilla.components.service.glean.net.ConceptFetchHttpUploader

val httpClient = ConceptFetchHttpUploader(lazy { HttpURLConnectionClient() as Client })
val config = Configuration(httpClient = httpClient)
Glean.initialize(
   context,
   uploadEnabled = true,
   configuration = config,
   buildInfo = GleanBuildInfo.buildInfo
)
```

</div>

<div data-lang="Swift" class="tab">

An excellent place to initialize Glean is within the `application(_:)` method of the class that extends the `UIApplicationDelegate` class.

```Swift
import Glean
import UIKit

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
    func application(_: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions _: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        // If you have custom pings in your application, you must register them
        // using the following command. This command should be omitted for
        // applications not using custom pings.
        Glean.shared.registerPings(GleanMetrics.Pings)

        // Initialize the Glean library.
        Glean.shared.initialize(
            // Here, `Settings` is a method to get user preferences specific to
            // your application, and not part of the Glean API.
            uploadEnabled = Settings.isTelemetryEnabled,
            buildInfo = GleanMetrics.GleanBuild.info
        )
    }
}
```

The Glean Swift SDK does not support use across multiple processes,
and must only be initialized on the application's main process.

<div data-lang="Python" class="tab">

The main control for the Glean Python SDK is on the `glean.Glean` singleton.


```python
from glean import Glean

Glean.initialize(
    application_id="my-app-id",
    application_version="0.1.0",
    # Here, `is_telemetry_enabled` is a method to get user preferences specific to
    # your application, and not part of the Glean API.
    upload_enabled=is_telemetry_enabled(),
)
```

Unlike in other implementations, the Python SDK does not automatically send any pings.
See the [custom pings documentation](../../user/pings/custom.md) about adding custom pings and sending them.

</div>

<div data-lang="Rust" class="tab">

The Glean Rust SDK should be initialized as soon as possible.

```Rust
use glean::{ClientInfoMetrics, Configuration};
let cfg = Configuration {
    data_path,
    application_id: "my-app-id".into(),
    // Here, `is_telemetry_enabled` is a method to get user preferences specific to
    // your application, and not part of the Glean API.
    upload_enabled: is_telemetry_enabled(),
    max_events: None,
    delay_ping_lifetime_io: false,
    channel: None,
    server_endpoint: Some("https://incoming.telemetry.mozilla.org".into()),
    uploader: None,
    use_core_mps: true,
};

let client_info = ClientInfoMetrics {
    app_build: env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION").to_string(),
    app_display_version: env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION").to_string(),
};

glean::initialize(cfg, client_info);
```

The Glean Rust SDK does not support use across multiple processes, and must only be initialized on the application's main process.

Unlike in other implementations, the Rust SDK does not provide a default uploader.
See [`PingUploader`](../../../docs/glean/net/trait.PingUploader.html) for details.
