_Modern Firefox Telemetry for mobile platforms_

`Glean` is a modern approach for a mobile Telemetry library.
It started out as an [android-components library](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/tree/master/components/service/glean), written purely in Kotlin to be used on Android.

`Glean` is an experiment to transform the concepts behind `Glean` into a cross-platform library based on a low-level [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) library and the necessary platform integrations for Android and iOS.

**Note: The cross-platform `Glean` project is in development. It's not finished, not used and not documented yet.**
